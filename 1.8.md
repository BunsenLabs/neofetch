### General

- Moved all whitespace trimming to a dedicated function.
    - Neofetch will no longer have any whitespace issues in the output.
    - See [trim()](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch/commit/d3c87cdaacf1ea9fbf245146c910dc53b49dba08#diff-e863270127ca6116fd30e708cdc582fcR2789)
- Only call `tput` when we really need to.
- Supress `getconfig` and `getscriptdir` errors.
- Fix issue when title and background were both color `7`.
- Added `--version` to print the neofetch version.
- The title at the top is now much more colorful.
- Supress `xprop` errors since it's now an optional dependency.
- Fix lint errors.
- Remove all instances of `! -z` since they're pointless.
- Quote all variable/command substitutions.
- Remove all `bc` usage by simplifying math.
- The prompt is now dynamically set in image mode instead of being anchored to the<br \>
bottom of the window. See [#279](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch/pull/279) for an example.
- Fix issue with incorrect text color when `barinfo` is set.

### Image

![terminology](https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmbVEUREBg4hMG22WrQ2bkt2sZZzyTEP5EEXmHRw7MHD6A)

- Added image support for terminology with `tycat`. **[@aranega](https://github.com/aranega)** \[1\]
- Added `--crop_mode none` / `crop_mode=none` to disable cropping the images.
- Added `--size none` / `size=none` to disable resizing / cropping the images.

\[1\] `tycat` is a terminology builtin that works similarly to w3m-img. Those using terminology<br \>
now have working image support.
