### Error Messages

Neofetch now supports displaying error messages and saving a verbose log for<br \>
troubleshooting.

![log](https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmeTWGKozY79zcxbrgXueyTRfQcTUe7ZmDqLv4ASgJB4G4)

- Added `-v` to print error messages to stdout.
- Added `-vv` to print a verbose log to stdout. \[1\]

\[1\] Use `neofetch -vv 2> file` to save a verbose log for bug reporting.

### Info

**prin**<br \>
- Format changes to fix issues with colons in string. This change also makes<br \>
`prin` use the same args as `info`.

```sh
# OLD Format
prin "Subtitle: Text goes here"

# NEW Format
prin "Subtitle" "Text goes here"
```

**Title**<br \>
- Made title faster by using `$HOSTNAME` when available.

**Underline**<br \>
- Underlining is no longer hardcoded to title length meaning you can now<br \>
underline any part of the output and the length will match.
- `$underline` was renamed to `$underline_enabled`.

```sh
# OLD Variable
underline="on"

# NEW Variable
underline_enabled="on"
```

**Distro**<br \>
- Fix arch issues with ARM cpus.
- We now use `uname -m` to get the arch instead of hardcoding `x86`.
- Moved distro detection to a function called `getdistro`.
- Fixed issue with `ascii_distro` not working.

**CPU**<br \>
- Fixed issues when cpu speed was < 1Ghz
- Cleanup of CPU function.
- Don't print `Dual-Core` or `Quad-Core` in CPU output.
- Changed the default speed type from `max` to `scaling_current`.

**GPU**<br \>
- [Linux] More GPU substitutions for AMD cards.
- Added BSD support using `glxinfo`.

**Memory**<br \>
- [Linux / Windows] Use `memavail` if available for a more accurate output.

**Packages**<br \>
- Package count now works when the user has multiple package managers installed.<br \>
For example, if the user has both `dpkg` and `pacman` installed the function will<br \>
add up the packages from both package managers to get a grand total. (`dpkg pkgs` + `pacman pkgs`)
- If the package count is `0` we don't display anything.

**Uptime**<br \>
- Fixed various issues with OS X and BSD.

**Desktop Environment**<br \>
- [ Linux ] Fallback to using `xprop` if `$XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP` is empty.
- Use `$de` instead of `$XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP` for wallpaper and theme detection.
- Fixed xprop bug with DE detection when X wasn't running.

**Window Manager Theme**<br \>
- Fixed bug when `$de` was unset.

**Color Blocks**<br \>
- Fixed bug when the blocks wrap a line causing a large white strip to appear.


### Ascii

- Added KDE neon ascii art.
- Added small OpenBSD ascii art.
    - Credit goes to ufetch.
- Reduced the size of NetBSD's ascii art.
- [Windows 8/8.1] Use modern windows ascii art.


### Colors

- Fixed bug with `--colors` not working with all 256 terminal colors.
- `--colors 7` now uses the color white. \[1\]
- `--colors fg` now uses the foreground color. \[1\]

\[1\] Neofetch tried to be smart before by assuming that the foreground color<br \>
would be white or black. This caused issues for those setting the foreground<br \>
color to red or etc. This change adds a new value for `--colors` and `colors=()`<br \>
called `fg` which will set the color to your foreground color.


### Progress Bars

- You can now enable/disable a border around the progress bars with `progress_border`.

```sh
# $progress_border on
[=====-----]

# $progress_border off
=====-----
```

- You can now individually set the progress bar characters by using<br \>
`progress_char_elapsed` and `progress_char_total`. This means that you can<br \>
have a seperate character for the elapsed and total portions of the bar.

```sh
# Examples with $progress_border on

# Elapsed: =
# Total: -
[=====-----]

# Elapsed: .
# Total: " "
[.....     ]

# Elapsed: /
# Total: " "
[/////     ]
```
